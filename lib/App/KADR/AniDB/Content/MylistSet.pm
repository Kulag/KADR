# ABSTRACT: AniDB information about a set of mylist entries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MylistSet lists the episodes and groups corresponding to a mylist query which
matches more than one entry.

Unfortunately, it is still missing qualifying data such as file versions,
and trying to narrow down results via mylist queries can be impossible in many
cases. I recommend using File and FileSet to narrow down results instead.

It's most useful property is probably its aggregate information about the
overall state of all the files in a user's mylist that correspond to a
particular episode number.
